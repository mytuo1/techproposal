### Technical Proposal: Agentic AI for Strategic Conference Planning

The Agentic AI for Strategic Conference Planning is a robust, multi-agent system implemented in Python using LangGraph, designed for seamless integration with IBM WatsonX Orchestrate. This system comprises five specialized agents to deliver personalized, cost-effective, and strategically aligned event recommendations for Crowdstrike employees. Below, we detail the technical architecture, agent functionalities, integrations with enterprise systems (Aha!, EPM, Amplitude), and supporting diagrams.

#### System Architecture
Built on LangGraph, a Python framework for multi-agent workflows, the system orchestrates five modular agents: Event Crawler, Event Relevancy Checker, Travel Agent, Communication Agent, and Observer Agent. Each agent is a containerized Python microservice, ensuring scalability and maintainability. WatsonX Orchestrate manages workflows, providing enterprise-grade deployment, fault tolerance, and integration with external APIs (e.g., Expedia, LinkedIn) and enterprise tools (e.g., SAP Concur, Microsoft 365, Aha!, EPM, Amplitude).

#### Agent Functionalities
1. **Event Crawler Agent**: This agent scrapes Crowdstrike’s official channels and web sources to identify sponsored or hosted events. Using Python’s `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries, it extracts event details (e.g., date, location, agenda) and stores them in a MongoDB database as structured JSON for downstream processing.

2. **Event Relevancy Checker Agent**: This agent evaluates event relevance by analyzing user data from LinkedIn profiles (via LinkedIn API) and internal skill profiles. Leveraging NLP with `transformers` (Hugging Face), it matches event topics to user skills and interests, prioritizing events with networking potential by cross-referencing LinkedIn connections for speakers or attendees.

3. **Travel Agent**: Interfacing with the Expedia API via Python’s `requests` library, this agent fetches real-time airfare, hotel, and transfer costs for event locations. It aggregates travel options, calculates total costs, and stores results in MongoDB for the Observer Agent.

4. **Communication Agent**: This agent delivers proactive notifications through Slack (using `slack-sdk`). It monitors event or travel cost changes over a six-month horizon, employing a cron-based Python scheduler for periodic checks. Users receive conversational updates and can refine preferences interactively.

5. **Observer Agent**: The system’s orchestrator, this agent aggregates data from all agents to compute total attendance costs (registration, travel, accommodations) using `pandas` for analysis. It ranks events by cost, selecting the three cheapest options while flagging more relevant, potentially costlier alternatives based on relevancy scores. Reports are stored in Box via API and aligned with enterprise goals using Aha! and EPM integrations.

#### Enterprise Integrations
- **Aha! Integration**: The Aha! API enables the Observer Agent to query product roadmaps and initiatives, ensuring event recommendations align with strategic goals. Using OAuth2-authenticated HTTPS requests, the agent maps event topics to Aha! features or initiatives, validating their relevance to Crowdstrike’s product development objectives.
- **EPM Integration**: Integration with Enterprise Performance Management systems validates event participation against departmental budgets and objectives. The Observer Agent uses EPM APIs to cross-check costs and ensure alignment with performance metrics, enhancing strategic decision-making.
- **Amplitude Integration**: Amplitude tracks user interactions with event recommendations, capturing engagement data (e.g., clicked events, ignored suggestions). Using Python’s Amplitude API client, the system refines recommendations over time, leveraging WatsonX’s analytics to optimize for user preferences and value-driven event features.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python 3.9+, LangGraph, `pandas`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `transformers`, `slack-sdk`.
- **APIs**: Expedia, LinkedIn, SAP Concur, Microsoft 365, Aha!, EPM, Amplitude, Box.
- **Database**: MongoDB for event and user data.
- **Deployment**: WatsonX Orchestrate with Kubernetes for containerized microservices.
